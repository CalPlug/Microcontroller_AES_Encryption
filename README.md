# Microcontroller_AES_Encryption

Please see the discussion of this code on:  https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/15156/simple-aes-encryption-example
This project is an example which was adapted into the following: https://github.com/CalPlug/ESP8266_Load_Controller

This project also contains a Base-64 bit encoder and a kansas City Standard converter from files to audio.  This was a test of the Base64 encryption and added to the project.
